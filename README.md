## Key Concepts

### Title Search Process

A **title search** involves reviewing public records to confirm the current legal ownership of a property and identifying any liens, claims, or encumbrances on it. This process helps verify that the seller has the legal right to transfer ownership to a buyer.

### Important Ownership Documents

Ownership documents come into play in various scenarios, such as inheritance, divorce, or the death of a property owner. Here are some key documents that may be necessary:

1. **Divorce Decree**
   - In divorce cases, the divorce decree outlines asset division, including real estate. If one spouse is awarded the property, a **Quitclaim Deed** may be used to transfer one spouse’s interest to the other.

2. **Probate Documents**
   - When a property owner passes away, **probate** ensures the legal transfer of assets. Key documents include:
     - **Probate Deed**: Used by an executor to transfer ownership to heirs.
     - **Will**: Outlines the distribution of the deceased’s assets.
     - **Letters Testamentary** or **Letters of Administration**: Court-issued documents authorizing an executor or administrator to manage the estate.

3. **Transfer Deeds**
   - **General Warranty Deed**: Transfers ownership with full guarantees of clear title.
   - **Special Warranty Deed**: Transfers ownership with limited guarantees, covering only the seller's ownership period.
   - **Quitclaim Deed**: Transfers ownership without guarantees, often used in divorce.

4. **Affidavit of Heirship**
   - Used when a deceased owner has no will, and formal probate is not required, this affidavit declares who the legal heirs are.

5. **Deed of Trust or Mortgage Documents**
   - A **Deed of Trust** may be needed if refinancing or mortgage assumption is required in divorce or probate cases.

6. **Transfer on Death Deed (TODD)**
   - Allows property to transfer directly to a beneficiary upon the owner’s death, avoiding probate.
