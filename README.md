Here’s an in-depth explanation of key concepts related to Title Search and the role of a Title Examiner:

1. Deed

Definition: A deed is a legal document that transfers ownership of real property from one party to another. It serves as proof of the transaction and is recorded in public records to make it official.

Types of Deeds:

1. General Warranty Deed: Offers the most protection to the buyer, as the seller guarantees that the property has a clear title, free of encumbrances.


2. Special Warranty Deed: The seller guarantees only that there are no title issues during their ownership period but does not guarantee against defects before they owned the property.


3. Quitclaim Deed: Provides the least protection. The seller transfers whatever interest they have in the property, with no guarantee of clear title or ownership.


4. Grant Deed: The seller guarantees that the property has not been sold to someone else and that there are no hidden liens.


5. Bargain and Sale Deed: Often used in tax sales or foreclosure transactions, this deed conveys property without warranties.

2. Mortgage

Definition: A mortgage is a loan secured by real estate property, where the borrower agrees to repay the lender over time, typically with interest. The property serves as collateral.

How It Relates to Title: When someone takes out a mortgage to buy a property, the lender often places a lien on the property. This lien is recorded in the title documents, and the title cannot be considered "clear" until the mortgage is paid off.

Types of Mortgages:

1. Fixed-Rate Mortgage: The interest rate stays the same throughout the loan term.


2. Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM): The interest rate can change periodically, based on changes in a corresponding financial index.


3. FHA Loan: Backed by the Federal Housing Administration, it requires a lower down payment and is easier to qualify for.


4. VA Loan: Available to veterans and service members, offering more favorable terms without requiring a down payment.

3. Assignment of Mortgage

Definition: This is a legal document that transfers the mortgage from the original lender to a new lender or investor. It signifies that the mortgage debt has been sold or transferred to another party.

How It Relates to Title: The assignment of mortgage must be recorded in public records, and a title search needs to identify the current holder of the mortgage. This ensures that when the loan is paid off, the correct party releases the lien.



---

4. Judgments

Definition: A judgment is a court's decision, often in the context of financial disputes, which can become a lien on a person's property if they are required to pay money and fail to do so.

How It Relates to Title: Judgments can create liens against real property, preventing the owner from selling or refinancing until the judgment is paid or settled.

Types of Judgments:

1. Money Judgment: A court orders the defendant to pay a specific sum of money to the plaintiff. This judgment can be attached to property as a lien.


2. Tax Lien Judgment: Imposed by the government when a property owner fails to pay property taxes. The lien must be satisfied before the property can be sold.


3. Mechanic’s Lien Judgment: A contractor or construction professional can place a lien on a property if the owner fails to pay for services rendered.


4. Foreclosure Judgment: Occurs when a borrower defaults on a mortgage. The lender can take legal action to repossess the property.





---

5. Liens

Definition: A lien is a legal right or interest that a creditor has in the debtor's property, granted until the debt is satisfied.

Types of Liens:

1. Mortgage Lien: Placed by a lender on the property as security for the loan.


2. Tax Lien: Imposed by the government for unpaid taxes.


3. Mechanic’s Lien: Placed by a contractor for unpaid work on the property.


4. Judgment Lien: Arises from court judgments that require the owner to pay a debt.





---

6. Easements

Definition: An easement is a legal right to use another person’s land for a specific purpose, such as utility access, roadways, or pipelines.

How It Relates to Title: Easements are recorded in the title and can limit how a property owner uses their land. When conducting a title search, easements must be identified to ensure they don't hinder property usage or affect its value.



---

7. Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CCRs)

Definition: CCRs are limitations or rules placed on a property within a subdivision, typically enforced by a homeowners' association. These rules dictate how property owners can use their land.

How It Relates to Title: CCRs are recorded as part of the property’s title and must be reviewed during a title search to ensure that the buyer understands any limitations on property use.



---

8. Building Setback Lines (BSL)

Definition: BSLs are boundaries established in property titles that restrict where structures can be built on the property. These lines dictate how far from the property lines a building must be set.

How It Relates to Title: BSLs are important to review to ensure compliance with local zoning laws. If a building violates these lines, it can affect the marketability of the property.



---

9. Chain of Title

Definition: The chain of title is the chronological order of property ownership transfers from the original owner to the current owner. It is used to trace the ownership history of the property.

How It Relates to Title: Any gaps or discrepancies in the chain of title can cause ownership issues. A title examiner ensures that each transfer is properly documented and identifies any potential ownership disputes.



---

10. Title Commitment

Definition: A title commitment is a document issued by a title company, promising to issue a title insurance policy upon completing certain conditions, such as clearing liens or resolving title defects.

How It Relates to Title: The title examiner plays a key role in preparing the title commitment by researching and confirming that the property title is free of any issues. Any conditions or exceptions are outlined in the commitment.

11. Role of a Title Examiner

Responsibilities:

1. Researching Property Titles: The examiner performs detailed searches of public records to identify the current owner, as well as any liens, easements, judgments, or restrictions.


2. Analyzing Documents: The examiner reviews deeds, mortgages, assignments, judgments, and other documents related to the property to ensure the title is clear.


3. Verifying Chain of Title: Ensuring all previous transfers of ownership are documented and that there are no gaps or legal issues in the ownership history.


4. Identifying Issues: Spotting problems such as unpaid taxes, undisclosed liens, or ownership disputes, and working with legal teams to resolve them.


5. Preparing Title Reports: Summarizing findings in title reports or title commitment documents that outline any exceptions or required actions to clear the title.


6. Customer Interaction: Communicating findings to clients (buyers, sellers, lenders) and providing detailed reports explaining any issues or requirements to clear the title.

12. Document Retrieval Tools

Common Tools: As a title examiner, you’ve mentioned using TG Express, BOC, SmartView, and Softpro Select. These tools help retrieve public records such as deeds, mortgages, judgments, and other documents necessary for conducting a thorough title search.

13. Exceptions in Title Search

Definition: Exceptions are issues found during a title search that prevent a property from having a clear title, such as existing easements, unresolved liens, or CCRs.

How It Relates to Title: Title examiners identify these exceptions and ensure they are properly disclosed in the title commitment so that they can be addressed before closing.



---

14. Turnaround Time (TAT)

Definition: TAT refers to the expected timeframe for completing a title search and delivering the necessary reports to clients.

Importance: Title examiners must work efficiently to meet these deadlines while ensuring that the title search is thorough and accurate.
